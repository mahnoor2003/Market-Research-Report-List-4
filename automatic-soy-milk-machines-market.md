<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Soy Milk Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Mesh</li><li>Without Mesh</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic soy milk machines can be categorized based on the presence of a mesh filter. Machines with mesh filters strain the soy milk during the extraction process, resulting in a smoother and more refined texture. On the other hand, machines without mesh filters may require additional straining to remove any solids or particles from the soy milk. Both types of machines offer convenience and efficiency in preparing fresh soy milk at home, but the presence of a mesh filter can contribute to a cleaner and more consistent end product.</p></p>
