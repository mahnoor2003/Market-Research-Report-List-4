<p><h1>Targeted Protein Degradation Market Analysis and Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2024 to 2031)</h1></p><p><strong>Targeted Protein Degradation Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Targeted protein degradation is an emerging therapeutic approach that involves selectively removing disease-causing proteins from cells. This process relies on small molecules called proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to target specific proteins for degradation by the cell's natural machinery. This novel method has gained attention in drug discovery due to its potential to target proteins previously considered "undruggable."</p><p>The targeted protein degradation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.1% during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases has spurred the demand for innovative therapies targeting specific disease-causing proteins. Pharmaceutical companies are investing in research and development of PROTACs and other targeted protein degradation technologies to address these unmet medical needs.</p><p>Moreover, the rise of personalized medicine and advances in proteomics and genomics are driving the growth of the targeted protein degradation market. These factors, along with the increasing focus on precision medicine and the potential advantages of targeted protein degradation over traditional drug development approaches, are expected to continue fueling the market growth.</p></p>
