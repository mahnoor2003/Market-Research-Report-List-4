<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Pipe Separators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Axis</li><li>Dual Axis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Exhaust pipe separators, also known as exhaust pipe hangers or exhaust pipe mounts, come in two main types: single axis and dual axis. Single axis separators allow movement in only one direction, typically angular movement, while dual axis separators allow movement in two directions, both angular and lateral. Single axis separators are commonly used for simple exhaust pipe setups, while dual axis separators are preferred for more complex or heavy-duty exhaust systems. Both types serve the important function of holding the exhaust pipe securely in place to prevent damage or excessive movement.</p></p>
