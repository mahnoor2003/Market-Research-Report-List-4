<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DR Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect FPD</li><li>Direct FPD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The DR Flat Panel Detector market can be divided into two main types: Indirect FPD and Direct FPD. Indirect FPDs use a scintillator material to convert X-rays into light, which is then detected by a photosensitive array, while Direct FPDs directly convert X-rays into electrical signals using amorphous selenium or other semiconductor materials. Indirect FPDs tend to have lower image quality and require thicker detectors, while Direct FPDs offer higher resolution and thinner detectors, making them more popular in the market.</p></p>
