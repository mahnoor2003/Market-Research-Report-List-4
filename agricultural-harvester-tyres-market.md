<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Harvester Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural harvester tyres come in two main types: Radial Agriculture Tires and Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires. Radial agriculture tyres are known for their flexibility and better traction, while bias (crossply) agriculture tyres are more durable and less expensive. Radial tyres have steel belts running across the tread, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications. Bias tyres, on the other hand, have crisscrossed ply layers, providing greater stability and strength. Both types cater to different needs and preferences of agricultural harvesters.</p></p>
