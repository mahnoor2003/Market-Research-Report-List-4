<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Film Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Film adhesion barriers are devices used to prevent the formation of adhesions after surgery. Absorbable barriers are made of materials that break down in the body over time, reducing the risk of complications. Non-absorbable barriers remain in place permanently to provide ongoing protection. Both types offer benefits in different situations; absorbable barriers are ideal for temporary use, while non-absorbable barriers are suitable for long-term adhesion prevention. Healthcare providers can choose the best option based on the patient's needs and the surgical procedure.</p></p>
