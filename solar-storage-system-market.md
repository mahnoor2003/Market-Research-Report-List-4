<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Storage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Li-ion</li><li>Lead-Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar storage systems are essential for storing excess energy generated from solar panels for use during periods of low sunlight. The two main types of solar storage systems are Li-ion and Lead-Acid. Li-ion batteries are known for their high energy density, longer cycle life, and faster charging capabilities, making them a popular choice for residential and commercial applications. Lead-Acid batteries, on the other hand, are more cost-effective but have a shorter lifespan and slower charging times. Both types play crucial roles in the growing solar storage system market.</p></p>
