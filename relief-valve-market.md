<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring-Type</li><li>Lever-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Relief Valve market consists of two main types: Spring-Type and Lever-Type valves. Spring-Type relief valves operate using a spring mechanism to control the pressure and release excess fluids when the pressure exceeds the preset limit. Lever-Type relief valves, on the other hand, use a lever mechanism to manually adjust the pressure threshold and release fluids accordingly. Both types are crucial in various industries such as oil and gas, chemical, and manufacturing, ensuring safety by preventing overpressure situations.</p></p>
