<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li><li>Non-Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HVAC actuators are devices that control the flow of air or water in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. There are two main types of HVAC actuators: Spring Return HVAC Actuator and Non-Spring Return HVAC Actuator. </p><p>Spring Return actuators use a spring to return the actuator to its default position when power is lost. Meanwhile, Non-Spring Return actuators do not rely on a spring and use other mechanisms to return to their default position. Both types are essential components in HVAC systems for regulating temperature and airflow.</p></p>
