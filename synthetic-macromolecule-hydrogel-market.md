<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Macromolecule Hydrogel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Hydrogel</li><li>Chemical Hydrogel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Physical hydrogels are formed through physical interactions like hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, or electrostatic interactions. They exhibit reversible swelling behavior based on external stimuli like temperature, pH, or ionic strength. Chemical hydrogels are synthesized through covalent bonds between polymer chains, leading to a permanent 3D network structure. They demonstrate high mechanical strength and stability but may show limited swellability compared to physical hydrogels. Both types of hydrogels have various applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and wound healing due to their biocompatibility and tunable properties.</p></p>
