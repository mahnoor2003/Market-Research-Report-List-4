<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quantitative PCR Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Probe-Based</li><li>SYBR Green</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Quantitative PCR kits are essential tools for measuring the amount of specific DNA in a sample. There are two main types of quantitative PCR kits available in the market: Probe-Based and SYBR Green. </p><p>Probe-Based kits utilize specific probes that bind to the target DNA sequence, emitting a signal that correlates with the amount of DNA present. SYBR Green kits, on the other hand, utilize a fluorescent dye that binds to all double-stranded DNA, emitting a signal that increases as the DNA amplifies. Both types of kits are widely used in research and diagnostic applications.</p></p>
