<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Homomorphic Encryption Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Partially Homomorphism</li><li>Fully Homomorphism</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Homomorphic encryption is a form of cryptography that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. Partially homomorphic encryption allows for either addition or multiplication operations to be performed on encrypted data, but not both. Fully homomorphic encryption, on the other hand, allows for both addition and multiplication operations to be performed on encrypted data, enabling more complex computations to be carried out without revealing any sensitive information. Both types of homomorphic encryption offer enhanced security and privacy for data processing applications.</p></p>
