<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prosthetic Disc Nucleus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery</li><li>Open Spine Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prosthetic disc nucleus market includes two main types: minimally invasive spine surgery and open spine surgery. In minimally invasive spine surgery, a smaller incision is made, leading to less tissue damage, shorter recovery time, and lower risk of complications. This type of surgery is gaining popularity due to its benefits. On the other hand, open spine surgery involves a larger incision and more extensive tissue disruption. It is still commonly performed for more complex spinal conditions that may not be suitable for minimally invasive techniques.</p></p>
