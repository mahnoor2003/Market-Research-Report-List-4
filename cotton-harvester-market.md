<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cotton Harvester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stripper Type</li><li>Spindle Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cotton harvesters are generally classified into two main types: Stripper type and Spindle type. Stripper type harvesters are more suitable for harvesting shorter staple cotton, as they remove both the cotton and a significant amount of plant material. Spindle type harvesters, on the other hand, are better suited for longer staple cotton, as they separate the cotton from the plant more gently. Both types of harvesters are widely used in the agricultural industry, catering to different needs based on the type of cotton being harvested.</p></p>
