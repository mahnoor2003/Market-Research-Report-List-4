<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Insulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Suspension Glass Insulators</li><li>Pin Glass Insulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glass insulators are used in electrical transmission and distribution systems to support and insulate wires. Suspension glass insulators are designed to hang vertically from overhead lines, while pin glass insulators are mounted horizontally on crossarms. Suspension insulators offer better mechanical strength and resistance to contamination, while pin insulators are simpler and more economical. Both types are important in the market, with suspension insulators being more commonly used in high voltage transmission lines and pin insulators more commonly used in lower voltage distribution lines.</p></p>
