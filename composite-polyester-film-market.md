<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Polyester Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension Type</li><li>Uniaxial Tension Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite polyester film is available in two main types: biaxial tension type and uniaxial tension type. Biaxial tension type film is created by stretching the film in both the machine direction and the transverse direction, resulting in improved strength and dimensional stability. On the other hand, uniaxial tension type film is stretched in only one direction, providing enhanced properties in that specific direction. Both types of film offer unique benefits for various applications in industries such as packaging, electronics, and automotive.</p></p>
