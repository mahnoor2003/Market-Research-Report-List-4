<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shunt Reactors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-core Dry Type</li><li>Oil Immersed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shunt reactors are used in power systems to compensate for the capacitive reactive power generated by long transmission lines. There are two main types of shunt reactors - air-core dry type and oil immersed type. Air-core dry type reactors use air as the medium for heat dissipation, while oil immersed type reactors use oil for insulation and cooling. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining power quality and stability in electrical grids by absorbing excess reactive power and improving system efficiency.</p></p>
