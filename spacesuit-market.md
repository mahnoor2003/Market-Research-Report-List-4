<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spacesuit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure Spacesuit</li><li>Hyperbaric Spacesuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spacesuits are specialized garments designed to protect astronauts from the harsh conditions of space. There are two main types of spacesuits: Low Pressure Spacesuits and Hyperbaric Spacesuits. </p><p>Low Pressure Spacesuits are used in spacewalks outside the spacecraft where the pressure is lower than that of Earth's atmosphere. They provide life support and thermal control to the astronaut.</p><p>On the other hand, Hyperbaric Spacesuits are used for missions in high-pressure environments, such as deep-sea diving or undersea exploration. They are designed to withstand the increased pressure and provide necessary life support systems.</p></p>
