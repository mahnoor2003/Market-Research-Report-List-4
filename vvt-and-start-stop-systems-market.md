<p><strong>The VVT and Start-Stop Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passenger</li><li>Commercial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Variable Valve Timing (VVT) systems optimize engine performance by adjusting the timing of the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves. This technology is widely used in both passenger and commercial vehicles to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Start-Stop systems automatically shut off the engine when the vehicle is at a standstill and restart it when the driver releases the brake pedal. This helps in saving fuel and reducing overall vehicle emissions. Both technologies are gaining popularity in the automotive industry for their ability to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact.</p></p>
