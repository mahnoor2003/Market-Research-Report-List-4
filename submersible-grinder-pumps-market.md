<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submersible Grinder Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Positive Displacement (SPD) Type</li><li>Centrifugal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submersible grinder pumps are available in two main types: Semi-Positive Displacement (SPD) Type and Centrifugal Type. </p><p>Semi-Positive Displacement (SPD) Type pumps operate by trapping a specific amount of fluid and then transferring it to the discharge pipe. This type is ideal for handling thicker liquids or slurry.</p><p>Centrifugal Type pumps use a rotating impeller to create a high-velocity flow of liquid, which is then directed towards the discharge port. This type is more suited for applications with higher flow rates and lower viscosity fluids.</p></p>
