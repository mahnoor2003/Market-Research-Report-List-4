<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiant Heating Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Radiation</li><li>Infrared Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiant heating panels are divided into two main market types: Electric Radiation Panels and Infrared Radiation Panels. Electric radiation panels use electricity to generate heat, which is then transferred to the surrounding area through convection and radiation. Infrared radiation panels, on the other hand, emit infrared radiation that directly heats objects and people in the room, providing a more efficient and targeted heating solution. Both types of radiant heating panels are popular choices for providing comfortable and energy-efficient heating in homes and commercial spaces.</p></p>
