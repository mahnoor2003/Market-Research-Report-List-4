<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Centrifugal Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Pump</li><li>Two-stage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine centrifugal pumps are classified into two main types based on the number of stages: single-stage pumps and two-stage pumps. Single-stage pumps have only one impeller and are commonly used for simpler applications with lower flow rates. Two-stage pumps, on the other hand, have two impellers and are best suited for applications requiring higher pressure or flow rates. They are more efficient in handling higher volume and pressure requirements in marine environments. Both types play a crucial role in various marine applications and industries.</p></p>
