<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isostatic Pressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Bag Pressing</li><li>Dry Bag Pressing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Isostatic pressing is a forming process where pressure is applied uniformly to a powder or compacted part in a sealed mold. Wet Bag Pressing involves compressing a wet powder or slurry inside a flexible, permeable bag, while Dry Bag Pressing involves compressing a dry powder inside a rigid, impermeable bag. Both types of isostatic pressing result in dense, uniform parts with high strength and accuracy. Wet Bag Pressing is preferred for forming complex shapes, while Dry Bag Pressing is used for simpler shapes and higher production volumes.</p></p>
